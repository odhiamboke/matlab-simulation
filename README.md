# Maximum Power Transfer Analyzer 🔌💡

Welcome to the world of electrical engineering with this MATLAB script that elegantly calculates the maximum power transfer to a load and identifies the critical resistance point.

## Features 🌟

- **Efficient Power Calculation**: Utilizes the maximum power transfer theorem to find the optimal load resistance for maximum power.
- **Dynamic Plotting**: Generates a plot of power versus load resistance, highlighting the critical points.
- **Educational Insight**: A great tool for students and engineers to visualize the principles of power transfer in circuits.

## Getting Started 🏁

1. Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your computer.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the script in MATLAB.
4. Run the script and observe the plot that illustrates the power transfer.

## How It Works ⚙️

The script uses the following formula to calculate the power transferred to the load:

$$ P_L = \left( \frac{V_s}{R_s + R_L} \right)^2 \times R_L $$

Where:
- \( V_s \) is the source voltage.
- \( R_s \) is the source resistance.
- \( R_L \) is the load resistance.

It then computes the derivative of the power with respect to the load resistance to find the critical point where the power is maximized.

## Plot Explanation 📈

The generated plot will show you how the power transferred to the load varies with the load resistance. The critical point, where the first derivative of the power curve changes sign, indicates the resistance value for maximum power transfer.
